# Getting the Results

The first thing to do is get the results into R. Unfotunaly all of the result files are PDFs so I'll have a fair amount of tidying to do once they are in.  

The results for the Mid America Region from 2011 to present are at 
[QuickFeis](https://www.quickfeis.com/Oireachtas). Each year has a page and then a button for each individual competition which will download the pdf. Since I don't want to spend hours clicking to open and save all the individual files I'm going to find a way to automate at least a good portion of the process.
